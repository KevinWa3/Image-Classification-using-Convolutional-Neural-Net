# Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Net-CNN- <br />
Image Classification of MIT Indoor Places using both TensorFlow and PyTorch. <br /> <br />
Data source from MIT containing over 15,000 images of indoor locations with 61 categories. I build and evaluate models using both TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Ultimately, using pre-trained models such as MobileNetV3Large and ResNet34 yielded the best results, with accuracy and f1-scores of above 0.60 for 61 classes. <br /> <br />
MITIndoorTF.ipynb and .html are the code file and html output of the CNN model using TensorFlow. <br />
